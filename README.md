# Angular Reddit Clone

## Description

Web application designed for users to post, discuss and rate content. The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application using Angular 1.6 for the frontend framework. This application was built over a week and a half and was also my first experience using Angular.

## Technologies Used

* [Angular 1.6](https://angularjs.org/) - Front-end web framework
